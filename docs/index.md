# Uniblocks
Uniblocks is an online game that was inspired by manyland. It's going to be
much simpler, but I still plan on adding physics, custom blocks, and
scripting.

## Live demo!
It's on (Github Pages)[https://ben1jen.github.io/uniblocks/game], at least
after I get it somewhat working, and launch a permenent server.
